## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze factors influencing bike rental demand and understand the patterns and variations in rental behavior across different weather conditions, seasons, and user types. The project aims to answer the following questions:

1. **Weather Influence:** Investigate whether people tend to rent bikes more on clear days compared to rainy or snow days.

2. **Seasonal Demand:** Identify the season(s) during which bike rental demand significantly increases.

3. **Weekly Variations:** Explore the weekly variations in bike rental demand and assess how these patterns differ between casual and registered users.

By addressing these questions, the project seeks to provide insights into the factors driving bike rental demand, which can inform decision-making for bike-sharing services and urban transportation planning.
